          community.

          The Portuguese, followed by the British, had a significant impact on

          hub, and Mumbai quickly grew in importance.

          Mumbai played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence.
          After gaining freedom in 1947, Mumbai became the capital of the newly
          formed state of Maharashtra in 1960.

          skyscrapers, and it continues to be a melting pot of diverse cultures
